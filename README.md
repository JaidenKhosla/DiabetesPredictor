# DiabetesPredictor
An app that predicts diabetes using machine learning.

To get everything to work, you have to first run the backend file, which is in Server/DiabetesPredictor.ipynb and Server/HeartDiseasePredictor (YOU ONLY NEED TO RUN THESE FILES ONCE AS THE MODELS SAVE ON YOUR HARD DRIVE). Click run all for both.
To get the frontend working, type "cd DiabetesPredictor" then type "npm run dev".
